##9.5.3

I am assuming that the these values collected by the owner of the vehicle are identically and indpendently sampled from a normal distribution of mpg readings of the car.  
```{r}
data = c(15.6,18.6,18.3,20.1,21.5,18.4,19.1,20.4,19.0)

test = t.test(x = data,mu = 20, alternative = 'less')
test
```

Since my p-value is 0.054 > 0.05, I fail to reject my null hypothesis at the 0.05 level, and thus I do not have enough evidence to claim the automobile has an average mpg of less than 20 mpg.
