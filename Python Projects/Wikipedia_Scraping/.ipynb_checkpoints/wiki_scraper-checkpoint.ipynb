    "In this notebook, I created a short Python script for scraping Wikipedia pages in order to obtain the hyperlinks listed in each section of the Wikipedia pages. Given a link to a Wikipedia page, this script should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Print the title of the page \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Print the header of each section\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Print the plain text of each section\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Print a list of the hyperlinks referenced in the paragraphs in each section (if present)\n",

    "Ultimately, I'd like to develop some text based ML models using Wikipedia page data. I think this script will work well for gathering natural language data on a variety of topics!"
